# Rust Template Repo

Scaffolding repo for new rust projects. It contains:

- Basic Travis file enforcing cargo clippy, fmt and unit tests (with advanced caching config)
- Basic Dockerfile for creating a minimal musl binary
- Mergify config and PR template

Feel free to suggest other things that should be included by default or make changes to existing defaults.
